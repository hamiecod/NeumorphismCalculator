# Introdution
---------------
This is a neumorphism calculator design made HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Designs
I made various designs in Figma for this project and they are as follows:<br />
* [Neumophism shapes](https://www.figma.com/file/S5U9rJ9a1IkvZC0LTO7SXm/neumorphismShapes)<br />
* [Portrait calculator design](https://www.figma.com/file/tGBHTWQp0KOLjkttrKesYT/NeumorphismCalculatorPortrait)<br />
* [Landspace calculator design(which i later decided to drop down)](https://www.figma.com/file/tGBHTWQp0KOLjkttrKesYT/NeumorphismCalculatorPortrait)
	
## Bugs
* Unresponsive Layout
* Replace the text in the backspace button with the image which is provided in the code in commented form or at `img/delete.png`. The problem while using the image instead of the text is that the button only works when you click on the boundary of the button and does not work when clicked on the image inside the button

## Improvements
* Add more functionality to the calculator in accordance to adding more functions to the calculator
* Add more neumorphism to the calculator
